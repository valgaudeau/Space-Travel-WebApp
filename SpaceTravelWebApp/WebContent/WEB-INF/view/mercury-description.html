	                Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, 
	                the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, 
	                messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes. 
	                Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the 
	                Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28 degrees. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western 
	                horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. 
	                At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. 
	                From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, 
	                which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days. 
	              </p>

	              <p>
	                Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin orbit resonance, 
	                meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes 
	                around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only 
	                once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.

					<h2>What is Mercury Like?</h2>
					<p>
						Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like Earth. 
						It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi). 
						Mercury is also smaller; albeit more massive than, the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. 
						Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.
					<p>
						Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering, 
						indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. It is more heterogeneous than either Mars's or the 
						Moon's, both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology, such as maria and plateaus. 
						Albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity, which include impact craters, the resulting ejecta, 
						and ray systems. Larger albedo features correspond to higher reflectivity plains. Mercury has dorsa 
						(also called "wrinkle-ridges"), Moon-like highlands, montes (mountains), planitiae (plains), rupes (escarpments), 
						and valles (valleys).
					</p>
					
					<p>
						There may be scientific support, based on studies reported in March 2020, for considering that parts of the planet Mercury 
						may have been habitable, and perhaps that life forms, albeit likely primitive microorganisms, may have existed on the planet.
					</p>
