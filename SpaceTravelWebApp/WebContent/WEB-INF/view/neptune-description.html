	                Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by 
	                diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive 
	                than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational 
	                compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU 
	                (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea, and is represented with
	                a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.  
	              </p>

	              <p>
	                Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather 
	                than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was 
	                subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted 
	                from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with 
	                a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, 
	                Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically 
	                until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study 
	                with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains 
	                the only spacecraft to visit Neptune

					<h2>What is Neptune Like?</h2>
					<p>
						Neptune is dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds. Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed 
						primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher 
						proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily 
						composed of ices and rock; Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction.
						Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance, though an unknown component 
						is believed to color Neptune a deeper blue compared to Uranus.
					<p>
						Neptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600 m/s 
						(2,200 km/h; 1,300 mph), nearly reaching supersonic flow. More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, 
						wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20 m/s in the easterly direction to 325 m/s westward. At the cloud tops, the 
						prevailing winds range in speed from 400 m/s along the equator to 250 m/s at the poles. Most of the winds on Neptune move 
						in a direction opposite the planet's rotation. The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high 
						latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a "skin effect" 
						and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes. At 70 degrees S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300 m/s.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system spanning 13,000 km x 6,600 km (8,100 mi x 4,100 mi) 
						was discovered by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. 
						The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter.
